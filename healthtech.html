<h1 style="color:#FB0404;"> Health and Technology </h1>

<pre> <p style="color:#FB0404;"> Did you know that though Health and Technology may seem 
completely different they are actually used together for many things like Biotech, this is a very
important field. </p>

Some examples of this field's creations include:
<ol style="color:#FB0404;">
<li> Stem Cells </li>
<li> Genetic modification </li>
<li> Fitness Devices </li> </ol>

<p style="color:#FB0404;"> But there are also some negative things about Health and Tech one such 
thing is how electronics affect your health negatively.

I am going to go into each of these things.

<h2 style="color:#FB0404;"> Stem Cells </h2>

<p style="color:#FB0404;">According to Stanford Childrens Health

"Stem cells are special human cells that are able to develop into many 
different cell types. This can range from muscle cells to brain cells. 
In some cases, they can also fix damaged tissues. Researchers believe that
stem cell-based therapies may one day be used to treat serious illnesses 
such as paralysis and Alzheimer disease.Stem cells are divided into 2 main
forms. They are embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.Embryonic stem
cells. The embryonic stem cells used in research today come from unused
embryos. These result from an in vitro fertilization procedure. They are
donated to science. These embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means
that they can turn into more than one type of cell. Adult stem cells. 
There are 2 types of adult stem cells. One type comes from fully developed
tissues such as the brain, skin, and bone marrow. There are only small
numbers of stem cells in these tissues. They are more likely to generate
only certain types of cells. For example, a stem cell that comes from the
liver will only make more liver cells. The second type is induced pluripotent
stem cells. These are adult stem cells that have been changed in a lab to be
more like embryonic stem cells. Scientists first reported that human stem
cells could be changed in this way in 2006. Induced pluripotent stem cells
don't seem to be different from embryonic stem cells, but scientists have
not yet found one that can develop every kind of cell and tissue." </p><hr>

<h2 style="color:#FB0404;"> Fitness Trackers </h2>

<p style="color:#FB0404;"> According to Wonderopolis.org 

"Most modern fitness trackers use a three-axis accelerometer as their primary
sensor. This advanced piece of technology measures acceleration based upon
start of motion, end of motion, and intensity. Fitness trackers collect data
that can then be processed with an internal computer chip and/or a smartphone
application." </p><hr>

<h2 style="color:#FB0404;"> Genetic Modification </h2>

<p style="color:#FB0404;"> According to Center for Genetics and Society and Kurzgesagt

Genetically modifiying humans can be used in two very different ways. Somatic genome editing changes the 
genes in a patient's cells to treat a medical condition. A few gene therapies are approaching clinical use
but remain extraordinarily expensive. By contrast, heritable genome editing would change genes in eggs,
sperm, or early embryos to try to control the traits of a future child. Such alterations would affect 
every cell of the resulting person and all subsequent generations. For these reasons genetically modifiying
humans is widely unnaccepted but we still modify plants, even the everyday banana has been modified some 
other examples are eggplants in Bangladesh that have their own natural pesticide that is harmless to humans
and papayas in Hawaii that were modified against the Ringspot virus which is kind of like Somatic 
Genome editing on plants, we could also use Somatic Genome editing on humans to cure dreaded diseases like
Cancer with mere Injections, we could also increase lifespans and make our bodies better at dealing with 
high energy food reducing obesity. There are many problems we can solve this way. </p><hr>

<h2 style="color:#FB0404;"> The effect of Electronics on your Health </h2>

<p style="color:#FB0404;"> MedicalNewsToday.com says

"Isolation is an issue with electronics. Technologies, such as social media,
are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the opposite effect
in some cases. A 2017 study says in young adults aged 19 to 32 years 
found that people with higher social media use were more than three times as
likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as
often. The authors of a 2016 systematic review discussed the link between
social networks and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. 
Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive 
interactions and social support on these platforms appeared to have lower
levels of depression and anxiety. However, the reverse was also true.
People who perceived that they had more negative social interactions online
and who were more prone to social comparison experienced higher levels of
depression and anxiety. So, while there does appear to be a link between
social media and mental health, a significant determining factor is the
types of interactions people feel they are having on these platforms.
Electronics also affect your physical health because too much time on 
them can cause eyestrain, aches, poor posture which can later lead to
Musculoskeletal issues, sleep problems, and reduced physical activity.</p></pre></body><grammarly-desktop-integration data-grammarly-shadow-root="true"></grammarly-desktop-integration></html>
